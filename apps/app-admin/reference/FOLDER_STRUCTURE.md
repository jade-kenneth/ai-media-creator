# Folder Structure

This structure combines a domain-first frontend application layout with a generic SDK library shape. It keeps routing thin, pushes business logic into feature modules, and separates reusable UI from app-specific workflows.

## Folder Responsibilities

### `components/`

Use this for reusable presentation and interaction building blocks.

- `ui/` contains design-system primitives such as buttons, dialogs, inputs, tabs, tables, and other shared low-level UI building blocks.
- Primitives should live under `components/ui/`, not at the root of `components/`.
- If a component is likely to be reused by multiple feature modules, place it under the root `components/` layer instead of inside a single feature.
- Shared components at the root of `components/` can be a single file when they are small and self-contained.
- Promote a shared component into its own folder when it is large enough or when it needs related files such as `utils.ts`, hooks, context, styles, lazy-loaded parts, or other code-splitting support.
- `core/` contains more advanced shared components that have their own internal context, anatomy, or composition model.
- `forms/` contains reusable field wrappers and form-specific adapters.
- `icons/` contains custom SVG icon components.
- `DataTable/` contains a reusable table system with filtering, pagination, and column controls.
- Root-level files in `components/` should be reserved for highly reusable app-wide components such as guards, page headers, and display helpers.

### `config/`

Use this for application-level runtime configuration and client setup.

- Examples: query clients, SDK initialization, app-wide configuration objects.

### `constants/`

Use this for shared constant values that do not belong to a single feature.

### `features/`

This is the main domain layer.

- Each folder represents one business capability or workflow.
- A feature owns its screens, local state, actions, feature-only helpers, and feature-only components.
- CRUD-style actions can live beside the main feature screen when they are tightly coupled.
- If a feature becomes large, add internal `hooks/`, `components/`, or `provider/` folders instead of leaking those files into shared layers too early.

### `graphql/`

Use this for frontend GraphQL documents, generated helpers, and GraphQL-specific client utilities grouped by backend domain.

### `hooks/`

Use this for generic hooks that are shared across multiple features.

- If a hook is only relevant to one feature, keep it inside that feature first.

### `pages/`

Use this for route entry points only.

- Keep page files thin.
- Pages should compose providers, guards, layouts, and feature components.
- Avoid putting business logic directly in route files unless the logic is route-specific.

### `providers/`

Use this for application-wide context providers and cross-cutting session or environment state.

- Examples: brand context, feature flags, export state, session switching, domain selection.

### `theme/`

Use this for the design system theme, component recipes, and styling tokens.

### `types/`

Use this for shared TypeScript types that are not owned by one feature.

### `utils/`

Use this for generic helpers that do not depend on React rendering and are shared across multiple parts of the app.

## Recommended Feature Template

Use this structure when creating a new feature module:

```text
features/
└── FeatureName/
    ├── FeatureName.tsx
    ├── FeatureNameContext.tsx
    ├── CreateFeatureName.tsx
    ├── UpdateFeatureName.tsx
    ├── DeleteFeatureName.tsx
    ├── hooks/
    ├── components/
    ├── types.ts
    ├── utils.ts
    └── index.ts
```

Guidelines:

- `FeatureName.tsx` is the main screen or container for the feature.
- `FeatureNameContext.tsx` is optional and should exist only when the feature has meaningful local shared state.
- `Create*`, `Update*`, `Delete*`, `View*`, or `Filter*` files should stay in the feature when they are not reused elsewhere.
- `components/` is for internal feature-only UI pieces.
- `hooks/` is for internal feature-only hooks.
- `index.ts` should expose the feature's public entry points.

## Rules For Keeping It Clean

- Keep `pages/` thin and domain logic in `features/`.
- Keep primitives in `components/ui/`.
- If a component can reasonably be reused across feature modules, move it to the root `components/` layer.
- Use a folder for a shared component when it grows beyond a single file or needs colocated helpers such as hooks, utils, context, or lazy-loaded subparts.
- Move code to `components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`, or `types/` only when it is actually shared.
- Prefer domain folders over technical folders inside `features/`.
- Keep feature-specific GraphQL usage close to the feature, but keep shared GraphQL clients and generated support files in `graphql/`.
- Use `Context.tsx`, `types.ts`, and `utils.ts` only when the module is large enough to justify them.
- Prefer `index.ts` files for clean imports at the folder boundary.
- Avoid creating deep nesting unless the module is genuinely large.

## SDK Library Details

The main recommended structure above already includes a generic `libs/sdk-library/src` branch. The details below show generic layout and export conventions for this kind of library.

### `core/report/` example structure

```text
core/
└── report/
    ├── graphql/
    │   └── EntityName.ts
    ├── index.ts
    ├── services.ts
    └── types.ts
```

Notes:

- `graphql/` contains report-domain GraphQL documents and generated fragments or query constants grouped by entity.
- `services.ts` is the main integration layer that imports from `graphql/` and exposes report API functions.
- `types.ts` contains the generated report GraphQL types.
- `index.ts` re-exports the public report API.

Recommended `core/report/index.ts` pattern:

```ts
export * from './services';
export * from './types';
```

### `react/` exact structure

```text
react/
├── index.ts
└── AuthProvider/
    ├── AuthProvider.tsx
    ├── index.ts
    ├── types.ts
    └── useAuth.ts
```

Current export pattern:

```ts
// react/index.ts
export * from './AuthProvider';

// react/AuthProvider/index.ts
export * from './AuthProvider';
export * from './types';
```

### `react-query/` example structure

If a `react-query` domain grows too large, split it into a folder while keeping the same public API.

```text
react-query/
├── index.ts
├── utils.ts
└── FeatureOrEntityName/
    ├── useFeatureOrEntityNameQuery.ts
    ├── useCreateFeatureOrEntityNameMutation.ts
    └── index.ts
```

Recommended root `react-query/index.ts` pattern:

```ts
export * from './FeatureOrEntityName';
```

Recommended `react-query/FeatureOrEntityName/index.ts` pattern:

```ts
export * from './useFeatureOrEntityNameQuery';
export * from './useCreateFeatureOrEntityNameMutation';
```

Guidelines:

- Keep a flat file when a domain is still small and readable.
- Promote a domain file into its own folder when it starts collecting many queries, mutations, shared input types, or helper logic.
- Keep the folder boundary clean with an `index.ts` that re-exports the domain hooks.
- Keep shared `react-query` helpers in `react-query/utils.ts`.

## Summary

This version favors:

- domain-first `features/`
- thin route files in `pages/`
- reusable shared UI in `components/`
- cross-feature state in `providers/`
- centralized shared hooks, types, and utilities

It is generic enough for similar admin or dashboard applications while still matching the structure patterns already present in the current codebase.
